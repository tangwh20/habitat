    "1. **Visual Scene Image**: A single image representing the current scene.\n"
    "2. **History Summary**: A summary of the robot's journey before the current step, focusing on the places visited and significant objects seen.\n"
    "3. **Last Navigation Step**: The most recent action taken by the robot, which may include a low-level command (e.g., `TURN RIGHT 30 DEGREES`).\n"
    "4. **Navigation Goal**: A text description of the robot's intended navigation goal.\n"
    "You should answer with a detailed history that includes:\n"
    "- **Places Visited**: A list of significant locations the robot has navigated through.\n"
    "- **Objects Seen**: A list of notable objects encountered during the navigation.\n"
    "- **Navigation Steps**: A sequence of reasoning steps that the robot has taken to reach its current position.\n"

    "1. **Be Concise**: The history should be detailed but not overly verbose. Focus on key locations and objects. Use no more than 3-4 sentences to summarize the journey.\n"
    "2. **Logical Flow**: Ensure the history follows a logical sequence of events leading to the current position.\n"
    "3. **Avoid Redundancy**: Do not repeat information unnecessarily; each entry should add new insights to the history.\n"
